Think hard about how to implement all the requirements
 described in @specs/requirements.md
 Create a detailed plan in a file "plan.md" with all the proposed tasks and subtasks,
  focusing on the flask routes and sqlalchemy models first 
  and add that the platform should build its own requirements.txt with pip install commands followed by a pip freeze
